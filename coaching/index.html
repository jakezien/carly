          <p>&ldquo;I could not have asked for a better or more rewarding experience than I had with Carly as an audition coach! Carly's encouraging and positive energy, along with her professional and organized program, helped me reach my goal of getting into my dream college, the University of Southern California.</p>
          <p>College auditions can seem daunting and impossible, but Carly met me where I was in my skill and experience and helped me grow.  Carly walked me through the process step by step, and tailored the experience exactly to my needs. While working on monologues, she encouraged me to simplify the process while showcasing my best qualities. Every session Carly gave me clear notes to apply to my work, that in result shaped my monologues in a clear and concise way. After each session, I felt the anxiety fade less and less and more confident that I could do this audition thing after all. Carly encouraged me to take emphasis off of the audition and onto the work. I was focusing on my own insecurities rather than being completely absorbed into the life of the character. Carly helped me overcome that block by putting emphasis on my character and what I was trying to say, and I became excited to tell my character's story.</p>
          <p>From outfit choices, to an audition warmup, I had as many tools as I needed to succeed. The day of the audition I felt calm and very prepared. I had laid the ground work and done the preparation necessary, and now it was time to have fun and shine. I have never left an audition feeling more proud of what I had done, because I knew whatever the outcome I had done my best work, all thanks to Carly. Carly invested time and true care into my work and journey of finding the perfect school for me. I truly could not have done it without her!"</p>

          <p>“Our work together served as a terrific foundation. Carly was great about disregarding a lot of the cliches about the monologue selection and was good at honing in on my ‘type’... It gave me a lot of clarity and confidence in the pieces I ultimately brought to the room. Also, she's just cool. I recommend her."</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Carly was absolutely amazing to work with as an acting coach! I went through the audition process on my own last year to get my feet wet and wanted to get a coach to make the most of auditioning this year. Carly helped me pick my pieces, work on my essay, tweak my resume and so much more.</p>
          <p>The best thing she did was always offer great energy, amazing advice and notes that took me to the next level. It also helped that she gave me the inside scoop on some of her training and warmup techniques. Carly is phenomenal to work with and I would recommend her to anyone. It was great that we could meet in person or that we could have a virtual session through Skype. If you choose to work with Carly then you will not be disappointed."</p>

          <p>&ldquo;When I first decided to apply to grad schools for drama, I had no idea where to begin. Carly really helped demystify the process. She was fully committed to my success, from helping me choose material to coaching me extensively on my monologues to providing words of encouragement and support on the big day. She is a warm, talented, and extremely knowledgeable coach, and I highly recommend her to anyone looking to take the next step forward in their acting career!"</p>
