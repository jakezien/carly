title:  "Acting Fellowship in Costa Rica"
---

I’m excited to announce that I’ve been accepted to Blue Zone 10, an acting fellowship in Costa Rica, from November 15-22.  Founded by Alaine Alldaffer, Casting Director at Playwrights Horizons, Blue Zone gives a small group of actors the opportunity to work on their visionary projects away from the bustle of New York City.

I’ll be using this trip to create a business plan for my coaching company, Carly Zien Coaching, and to further develop my vision: to found a studio in the heart of Brooklyn where artists can feel inspired, empowered, and motivated to create.

For more on the fellowship, visit www.costaricaactors.com.

Also, I’m raising money to fund this trip.  If you’d like to donate, please visit my GoFundMe page, at www.gofundme.com/carlycostarica.
