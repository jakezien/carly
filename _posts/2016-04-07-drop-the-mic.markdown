title:  "Drop the Mic: A Four-Week Audition Intensive"
---

I'm excited to announce that I'm teaching an audition class this May! Sign up for **Drop the Mic: A Four Week Audition Intensive.**

<br/>

In class we willâ€¦

- Practice the whole audition package, from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. It's so much more than just the sides you're working on.

- Break through barriers that prevent you from doing your best work

- Strategize how to **get more auditions** and **book more work.**

<br/>
