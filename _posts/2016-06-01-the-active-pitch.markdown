title:  "The Active Pitch: Public Speaking Coaching for Corporations"
---

Do you struggle with public speaking at work? Do you suffer from stage fright before presentations or pitches? Or do you simply want to learn how to communicate more powerfully and effectively?  I can help.  A Yale MFA trained-actress and entrepreneur, I bring my business savvy and elite knowledge of vocal and physical training to every session.
I offer one-on-one sessions, group packages, online coaching, and one-day and weekend Mastermind Workshops.  
Communication. Connection. Results.
