The cast of _One Slight Hitch_, which played from July 8-24 at the Totem Pole Playhouse, was thrilled to perform the show for their playwright, comedian Lewis Black.  It was such a treat to hear him laughing in the audience.

Pictured below is the cast with Mr. Black, and the cast in their eighties finery.
